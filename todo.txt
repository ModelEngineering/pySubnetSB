1.1 Better repo
2.1 Create jupyter example
3. Create samples for command line
5.1 Evaluation of the effectiveness of constraints
Analysis
  1. Evaluate significance of biomodels induced models
  3. Detailed analysis of
     a. Characterize weak structural identical
     b. Are strong structural identical multitone?
  4. Validations
     weak is cluster superset of strong
     sirn is cluster superset of naive
  5. Statistics for clusters: cluster_size, clustereq1, clustergt1_size
  6. Examine strong clusters to see differences. Simulate.
Data
1. Create datasets for weak and strong analysis of BioModels
2. Create dataset for summarizes of BioModels models by number of reactions, species
