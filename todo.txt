FSIRN - finding structural subnets (pySubnetSB)
1. max_num_assignments is broken, likely because of batching
2. Search for cyclic subnets
   a. Serialize BioModels
   b. Look for oscillator file
3. Select random subnetwork from an SBML model
4. Reverse the order of arguments in NetworkBase.makeRandomReactionByType
5. Good implementation of hash
5.1 Evaluation of the effectiveness of constraints
6. Script to find networks that contain an antimony file as a subset
Analysis
  1. Plot indeterminant vs. max_num_perm; do for naive algorith as well
  2. Provide statistics on structurally identicaly by type and dataset
  3. Detailed analysis of
     a. Characterize weak structural identical
     b. Are strong structural identical multitone?
  4. Validations
     weak is cluster superset of strong
     sirn is cluster superset of naive
  5. Statistics for clusters: cluster_size, clustereq1, clustergt1_size
  6. Examine strong clusters to see differences. Simulate.
Subset detection
1. Is there a fast way to determine if one array is a subset of another?
