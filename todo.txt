DSIRN
1. Encoding includes pairs of arrays
2. Use this encoding in iterating over subsets
3. Network.isSubset
Analysis
  1. Plot indeterminant vs. max_num_perm; do for naive algorith as well
  2. Provide statistics on structurally identicaly by type and dataset
  3. Detailed analysis of
     a. Characterize weak structural identical
     b. Are strong structural identical multitone?
  4. Validations
     weak is cluster superset of strong
     sirn is cluster superset of naive
  5. Statistics for clusters: cluster_size, clustereq1, clustergt1_size
  6. Examine strong clusters to see differences. Simulate.
Subset detection
1. Is there a fast way to determine if one array is a subset of another?
