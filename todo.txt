1.1 Better repo
2.1 Create jupyter example
3. Create samples for command line
5.1 Evaluation of the effectiveness of constraints
Analysis
  1. Evaluate significance of biomodels induced models.
    a. Compare appproximate significance level with simulations
    b. Scatter plot with greyed out points for low significance level (or different size? <0.01, <0.05, >0.05)
      (1) CSV file summarizing biomodels - num_species, num_reaction, probability of occurrence
      (2) Subnet.csv reports on pairs where subnet is found
  3. Detailed analysis of
     a. Characterize weak structural identical
     b. Are strong structural identical multitone?
  4. Validations
     weak is cluster superset of strong
     sirn is cluster superset of naive
  5. Statistics for clusters: cluster_size, clustereq1, clustergt1_size
  6. Examine strong clusters to see differences. Simulate.
Create mk_plots
Data - mk_data
1. Data in data/README.md
2. Starts from full_biomodels<weak | strong>.csv, biomodels_serialized.txt, oscillators_serialized.txt
