DSIRN
1. Refactor to use constraints, both enumerated and categorical
  a. Implement Constraint, SpeciesConstraint, ReactionConstraint
     Species: pred, succ X reaction type
              number autocat reaction
     Reaction: pred, succ X reaction type
              number autocat species
  a1: classify reaction using reactant_nmat, product_nmat
      sum columns, max is 3, form pairs
  a2: Evaluation. Count duplicate rows in criteria mats as increase
      network size.
  b. Evaluate quality of constraints on benchmark networks
     For pattern and target of different sizes
       Calculate the number of permutations to evaluate based on
       compatible evaluations
  c. Integrate with Network
    a) Define reactant, product for weak identity
    b) Constructing hashes
    c) IsStructurallyIdentical - species, reactions X enumerated, categorical
6. Script to find networks that contain an antimony file as a subset
Analysis
  1. Plot indeterminant vs. max_num_perm; do for naive algorith as well
  2. Provide statistics on structurally identicaly by type and dataset
  3. Detailed analysis of
     a. Characterize weak structural identical
     b. Are strong structural identical multitone?
  4. Validations
     weak is cluster superset of strong
     sirn is cluster superset of naive
  5. Statistics for clusters: cluster_size, clustereq1, clustergt1_size
  6. Examine strong clusters to see differences. Simulate.
Subset detection
1. Is there a fast way to determine if one array is a subset of another?
