Then, we compare the overall performance of these algorithms with Glasgow, an algorithm based on the constraint programming. Through experiments, we find that (1) the filtering method of {GraphQL} is competitive to that of the latest algorithms {CFL}, {CECI} and {DP}-iso in terms of pruning power; (2) the ordering methods in {GraphQL} and {RI} are usually the most effective; (3) the set intersection based local candidate computation in {CECI} and {DP}-iso performs the best in the enumeration; and (4) the failing sets pruning in {DP}-iso can significantly improve the performance when queries become large.

We describe the participants’ responses to our questions highlighting common patterns and challenges. We further reviewed user feedback in the mailing lists, bug reports, and feature requests in the source repositories of a large suite of software products for processing graphs. Through our review, we were able to answer some new questions that were raised by participants’ responses and identify speciﬁc challenges that users face when using different classes of graph software. The participants’ responses and data we obtained revealed surprising facts about graph processing in practice. In particular, real-world graphs represent a very diverse range of entities and are often very large, and scalability and visualization are undeniably the most pressing challenges faced by participants.

However, existing subgraph matching frameworks mainly focus on pairwise graphs and the existing techniques can not efﬁciently be applied to search subgraph containment at low costs. Therefore, this paper proposes {HyperISO} to efﬁciently search subgraph containment that consists of three parts: 1) new ﬁltering techniques driven by exploring the properties and connections of hyperedges to reduce unpromising products for the sake of low matching costs, 2) a novel ordering strategy that is able to generate an optimized matching process by considering both the sizes of hyperedge candidates and the unmatched vertices of the hyperedges, and 3) a dual enumeration algorithm to list both the vertex and hyperedge mappings. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data show that {HyperISO} outperforms the best among the sophisticated subgraph matching frameworks and meanwhile verify the efﬁciency of {HyperISO} in various types of hypergraphs.},

	shorttitle = {{HGMatch}},
	abstract = {Hypergraphs are a generalisation of graphs in which a hyperedge can connect any number of vertices. It can describe n-ary relationships and high-order information among entities compared to conventional graphs. In this paper, we study the fundamental problem of subgraph matching on hypergraphs (i.e. subhypergraph matching). Existing methods directly extend subgraph matching algorithms to the case of hypergraphs. However, this approach delays hyperedge veriﬁcation and underutilises the high-order information in hypergraphs, which leads to large search space and high enumeration costs. Furthermore, with the growing size of hypergraphs, it is becoming hard to compute subhypergraph matching sequentially. Thus, we propose an efﬁcient and parallel subhypergraph matching system, {HGMatch}, to handle subhypergraph matching in massive hypergraphs. We propose a novel match-by-hyperedge framework to utilise highorder information in hypergraphs and use set operations for efﬁcient candidate generation. Moreover, we develop an optimised parallel execution engine in {HGMatch} based on the dataﬂow model, which features a task-based scheduler and ﬁne-grained dynamic work stealing to achieve bounded memory execution and better load balancing. Experimental evaluation on 10 real-world datasets shows that {HGMatch} outperforms the extended version of the state-of-the-art subgraph matching algorithms ({CFL}, {DAF}, {CECI}, and {RapidMatch}) by orders of magnitude when using a single thread, and achieves almost linear scalability when the number of threads increases.},

	abstract = {Nitric oxide ({NO}) produced by vascular endothelial cells is a potent vasodilator and an antiinﬂammatory mediator. Regulating production of endothelial-derived {NO} is a complex undertaking, involving multiple signaling and genetic pathways that are activated by diverse humoral and biomechanical stimuli. To gain a thorough understanding of the rich diversity of responses observed experimentally, it is necessary to account for an ensemble of these pathways acting simultaneously. In this article, we have assembled four quantitative molecular pathways previously proposed for shear-stress-induced {NO} production. In these pathways, endothelial {NO} synthase is activated 1), via calcium release, 2), via phosphorylation reactions, and 3), via enhanced protein expression. To these activation pathways, we have added a fourth, a pathway describing actual {NO} production from endothelial {NO} synthase and its various protein partners. These pathways were combined and simulated using {CytoSolve}, a computational environment for combining independent pathway calculations. The integrated model is able to describe the experimentally observed change in {NO} production with time after the application of ﬂuid shear stress. This model can also be used to predict the speciﬁc effects on the system after interventional pharmacological or genetic changes. Importantly, this model reﬂects the up-to-date understanding of the {NO} system, providing a platform upon which information can be aggregated in an additive way.},

	abstract = {{ErbB} tyrosine kinase receptors mediate mitogenic signal cascade by binding a variety of ligands and recruiting the different cassettes of adaptor proteins. In the present study, we examined heregulin ({HRG})-induced signal transduction of {ErbB}4 receptor and found that the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase ({PI}3K)-Akt pathway negatively regulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ({ERK}) cascade by phosphorylating Raf-1 on Ser259. As the time-course kinetics of Akt and {ERK} activities seemed to be transient and complex, we constructed a mathematical simulation model for {HRG}-induced {ErbB}4 receptor signalling to explain the dynamics of the regulation mechanism in this signal transduction cascade. The model reﬂected well the experimental results observed in {HRG}-induced {ErbB}4 cells and in other modes of growth hormone-induced cell signalling that involve Raf-Akt cross-talk. The model suggested that {HRG} signalling is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A as well as Raf-Akt cross-talk, and protein phosphatase 2A modulates the kinase activity in both the {PI}3K–Akt and {MAPK} (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways.},

Over the years, researchers have made significant headway in this direction with many state-of-the-art algorithms aimed at providing an efficient solution for approximate subgraph matching ({ASM}). Although many studies have been conducted to compare these and highlight their respective advantages and differences, little analysis has been done on how varying the different aspects of an {ASM} approach including the depth and breadth of neighborhood affect the performance. In this paper, we propose {VeNoM}, a variant of a state-of-the-art {ASM} algorithm {VELSET}, and present different extensions of it by parameterizing the breadth and depth of the neighborhood considered. We discuss the effects of these neighborhood parameters and other graph parameters on performance through empirical results over diverse datasets. We also compare the {VeNoM} instances against {VerSaChI}, a twohop neighborhood similarity based {ASM} approach. The empirical results suggest that increasing the depth of a neighborhood can increase the accuracy of {ASM} significantly, although it requires a much longer running time. The breadth of the neighborhood for a vertex does not matter much as long as it is more than a single edge.},

Despite successes in finding active subnetworks in the context of a single species, the idea of overlaying lists of differentially expressed genes on networks has not yet been extended to support the analysis of multiple species' interaction networks. To address this problem, we designed a scalable, cross-species network search algorithm, {neXus} (Network - cross(X)-species - Search), that discovers conserved, active subnetworks based on parallel differential expression studies in multiple species. Our approach leverages functional linkage networks, which provide more comprehensive coverage of functional relationships than physical interaction networks by combining heterogeneous types of genomic data. We applied our cross-species approach to identify conserved modules that are differentially active in stem cells relative to differentiated cells based on parallel gene expression studies and functional linkage networks from mouse and human. We find hundreds of conserved active subnetworks enriched for stem cell-associated functions such as cell cycle, {DNA} repair, and chromatin modification processes. Using a variation of this approach, we also find a number of species-specific networks, which likely reflect mechanisms of stem cell function that have diverged between mouse and human. We assess the statistical significance of the subnetworks by comparing them with subnetworks discovered on random permutations of the differential expression data. We also describe several case examples that illustrate the utility of comparative analysis of active subnetworks.},

	abstract = {Background: The mechanisms underlying complex biological systems are routinely represented as networks. Network kinetics is widely studied, and so is the connection between network structure and behavior. However, similarity of mechanism is better revealed by relationships between network structures.
Results: We define morphisms (mappings) between reaction networks that establish structural connections between them. Some morphisms imply kinetic similarity, and yet their properties can be checked statically on the structure of the networks. In particular we can determine statically that a complex network will emulate a simpler network: it will reproduce its kinetics for all corresponding choices of reaction rates and initial conditions. We use this property to relate the kinetics of many common biological networks of different sizes, also relating them to a fundamental population algorithm.
Conclusions: Structural similarity between reaction networks can be revealed by network morphisms, elucidating mechanistic and functional aspects of complex networks in terms of simpler networks.},

	abstract = {Similarity studies are important for chemistry and their applications range from the periodic table to the screening of large databases in the searching for new drugs. In this later case, it is assumed that similarity in molecular structure is related to similarity in reactivity. However, we state that structural formulas can be regarded as abstract representations emerging from the analysis of large amounts of data upon chemical reactivity. Hence, chemical formulas such as organic functions are not direct pictures of the atomic constitution of matter, but signs used to represent similarity in the reactivity of a class of substances. Therefore, reactivity, rather than molecular structure, becomes the fundamental feature of chemical substances. As reactivity is important, chemical identity is given by the relations substances establish with each other, giving place to a network of chemical reactions. We explore similarity in the network rather than in molecular structure. By characterising each substance in terms of the related ones, we show how Category Theory helps in this description. Afterwards, we study the similarity among substances using topological spaces, which leads us to concepts such as closure and neighbourhood, which formalise the intuition of things lying somewhere near around. The second focus of the chapter is the exploration of the potential of closure operators, and of topological closures in particular, as more general descriptors of chemical similarity. As we introduce the formalism, we develop a worked example, concerning the analysis of similarity among chemical elements regarding their ability to combine into binary compounds. The results show that several of the trends of chemical elements are found through the current approach.},

	abstract = {New tools and software in systems biology require testing and validation on reaction networks with desired characteristics such as number of reactions or oscillating behaviors. Often, there is only a modest number of published models that are suitable, so researchers must generate reaction networks with the desired characteristics, a process that can be computationally expensive. To reduce these computational costs, we developed a data base of synthetic reaction networks to facilitate reuse. The current database contains thousands of networks generated using directed evolution. The network are of two types: (1) those with oscillations in species concentrations and (2) those for which no oscillation was found using directed evolution. To facilitate access to networks of interest, the database is queryable by the number of species and reactants, the presence or absence of autocatalytic and degradation reactions, and the network behavior. Our analysis of the data revealed some interesting insights, such as the population of oscillating networks possess more autocatalytic reactions compared to random control networks. In the future, this database will be expanded to include other network behaviors.},

In this critical review, we discuss four commonly used network representations of chemical and biochemical pathways. We illustrate how some of these representations reduce network complexity but result in the ambiguous representation of biochemical pathways. We also examine the current theoretical approaches available to investigate the dynamic behaviour of chemical and biochemical networks. Finally, we describe how the critical chemical and biochemical pathways responsible for emergent dynamic behaviour can be identified using network mining and functional mapping approaches.},
